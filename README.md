# TextEditorJava
A basic text editor in Java using the Swing Framework

A list of components added to the editor :
1) A "Open" Box : Gives you a file opener UI.
2) A "Clear" Box to erase all the text in the text_area.
3) A block to represent the name of the document currently open.
4) A "save" block to save the contents to the currently open document .
5) An "options" block with "Save As" , "Find" , "GoToLine" , "Cut" , "Copy" and "Paste" capabilities.

The program makes use of the javax.swing Package and a few java.io Classes.

Missing features :
1)Adding responses to keypresses for save / saveAs & cut/copy/paste ( Use Java Mnemonics class )
2)Using fileDialog instead of the manual implementation ( Seriously I wish I knew about it back when i was writing this code )
